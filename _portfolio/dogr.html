<h3>Client</h3>
<p>Noble Desktop</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>To teach up-and-coming coders responsive HTML email development techniques that work with both modern and legacy email systems.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>At the time of creation, Gmail, among other email clients, was not yet supporting the use of media queries.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>This email is a basic two-column product-focused email with a hero section.</p>
<p>The email folds into a single column naturally on mobile, using a hybrid approach.</p>
<p>Microsoft conditional comments are implemented to maintain structure in Outlook.</p>
<p>Media queries are included to smooth out and enhance the mobile version of the email where supported.</p>
