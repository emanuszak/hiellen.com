<h3>Client</h3>
<p>A top-25 Fortune 500 financial institution</p>
<p>All content has been replaced due to privacy/disclosure, but the code base remains as was deployed.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Turn newsletter design mockup into a newsletter template to be reused each month with new content</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Required high support for Windows Outlook, BlackBerry.</p>
<p>The design asked to have images swapped out between the desktop and mobile versions, but display properties are not widely supported across clients.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>This email is a two-column newsletter-style email.</p>
<p>The accompanying images for the articles are swapped out for mobile-specific images when viewed on the phone.  The display hide/show is achieved using !mso conditional comments in order to properly hide the mobile-specific images in Outlook.</p>
<p>The hero is a background image, with uses both CSS background properties and also Microsoft VML to ensure visibility in Outlook.</p>
